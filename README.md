## Recommended learning path
### 1. Begin with Rust Basics
* [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) - Introductory book to Rust. It's fun and accessible, but it assumes you have programmed before in a different programming language.
* [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) - Exercises (please read their `README.md`).
* [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) - A set of examples, it will come in handy for quickly refreshing the language syntax.

It is recommended to complete corresponding exercises after each chapter of the book. See the [mapping](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/tree/main/exercises#exercise-to-book-chapter-mapping).

Alternatively:
* [Rust Programming Tutorial](https://youtu.be/T_KrYLW4jw8) - A Youtube course, which is more accessible for people who have just started programming.
* [Easy Rust](https://dhghomon.github.io/easy_rust/Chapter_1.html) - This is an introductory Rust book written in easy English. May be useful if you struggle with the [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) book.

### 2. Learn the basics of embedded
* [The Discovery book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/f3discovery/02-requirements/index.html) - Introductory book to embedded programming in Rust. No prior experience required.

You need to have either STM32F3DISCOVERY or Micro:bit evaluation boards. Ask your team's leader for availability.

### 3. Start working on a project
Ask you team's leader for a task or a small project to sharpen your skills.

### 4. Choose your way forward
Depending on your needs, you may want to learn things in a different order, So here is a list of great resources:
 * [The Embedded Rust book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/) - Intermediate book about embedded in Rust.
 * [Programming Rust](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/) - Rust book for experienced developers.
 * [Crust of Rust: Build Scripts and Foreign-Function Interfaces (FFI)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pePqWoTnSmQ) - 2 hour video about interfacing with C code.

## Great articles
### Type-driven development
* [Parse, don't validate - Alexis King](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)
### Automated reasoning
* [Announcing the Kani Rust Verifier Project](https://model-checking.github.io/kani-verifier-blog/2022/05/04/announcing-the-kani-rust-verifier-project.html)
